/**
* greebo: When creating model surfaces from ASE models, the in-game loading code 
* will aim to merge vertices that are near each other (and have otherwise negligible
* differences for their other components like normal, texcoords and colour).
* 
* The in-game code is using a custom vertex hash index implementation to quickly
* look up almost-similar vertices and prevent such "duplicates" from ending up in the 
* final mesh. This is based on a set of epsilon (one for each type, in CVARs like 
* r_slopVertex, r_slopNormal, etc.) and to speed things up, a hash index is built
* for all the vertices in a single mesh.
* 
* The hash functors below aim to reproduce this behaviour without fully re-implementing
* those custom containers in the engine code, designed to be used in a std::unordered_map
* with ArbitraryMeshVertex used as Key type.
* 
* The ArbitraryMeshVertex hash functions is deliberately coarse and will produce lots of
* collisions for vertices in a certain vicinity, only provide a fast way of looking up 
* duplicates in meshes with many verts. Each "colliding" vertex will then be compared
* in-depth by the std::equal_to<> specialisation, where the epsilon-comparison is performed.
